# Music Around the World
Our game, Music Around the World, allows its users to learn about the culture and instruments of 10 different countries and 5 different
regions from across the globe. Users are allowed to complete small quiz games and create their own music as well as view different scenes from various countries. Music Around the World was created for kids to explore countries they have never been to in order to learn about new languages, festivals, cultures, and music genres.

This entire project was completed using Unity 2D (C#), FMOD Studio, and Ableton.

## File Organization

All files were created within Unity 2D.

### `./CreativeCompStudioProject/CreativeCompStudioProject/Assets`

This file contains all images, scripts, and scenes used to create our game. Scrpts were used to create avatar and airplane movements as well as make game objects such as buttons and quiz options to work as desired.

### `./CreativeCompStudioProject/CreativeCompStudioProject/Assets/Scenes`

Scenes within Unity are the primary contents within the game. Scenes are categorized by the overall region, map, or country. We also have a WelcomeScreen Scene and a HowToPlay scene. Each scene file encompasses images, scripts, and different unity objects.

## Missing Elements

The user must unlock all 10 instruments before being able to conduct their international orchestra within the Instrument Room.
